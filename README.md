## Project Overview

This is a social project focused on evangelization groups in vulnerable areas, helping people get to know God better while providing physical comfort, such as coffee and a snack. We created this page because many of those we help ask where we are from and which Christian community we belong to.

**>> Our project will include the following:**
- A presentation page.
- WhatsApp contact.
- A prayer request form with fields for Name and Reason; when submitted, the request will be forwarded to a prayer group on WhatsApp.
- Static information about the addresses of Christian communities we are familiar with.

Deploy in production by: https://app.netlify.com/

**Stack:** React / HTML / CSS / Tailwind / CSS

**>> Our second version will include additional functionalities:**
- A presentation page.
- Registration of social groups for the evangelization of evangelical Christian churches that profess the same faith and believe in the same doctrine, regardless of the church name. Upon registration, there will be an acceptance period for verification according to specific criteria.
- Registration of Christian social groups.
- A search field for churches and evangelization groups.
- An enhanced prayer request form with the option to send the request to all registered prayer groups or to select specific groups.

**Stack:** React / Node.js / MongoDB / Redux
